# JWT Spring Boot Starter

![CI](https://github.com/joshlong/jwt-spring-boot-starter/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Bespoke JWT login support for both reactive and non-reactive example applications. See the samples for examples.

This autoconfiguration makes it trivial to stand up a `/token` endpoint that - given an HTTP BASIC authentication with a username/passowrd - vends a `token`.
